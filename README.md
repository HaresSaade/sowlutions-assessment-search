This is a simple angular project with no tuff design but the logic is there,
where you can search and articles with the searched keywords would appear highlighted.

So after retrieving make sure you have nodeJs and Angular CLI installed

and after retrieving install the dependencies using the command
"npm install"

then run it using the command
"ng serve or ng s"

check the result on http://localHost:4200

start typing in the search box and see the results articles appearing
containing your keywords and being highlighted.
